  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      We enjoyed our stay with Alejandro and his family. His brother makes the best Mojito, you should definitely try it. What we enjoyed the most was hanging with the friends and having a small insight about the real life in Cuba. They also helped us to organize a cab to the airport, which we appreciate a lot.

      Fantastic place. Walking distance to the center of Trinidad. True Cuban experience. Very comfortable room with balcony, clean and spacious. The most important: great, hostable people. All service in place: organizing trips, food, drinks.
